# Number Conversion Tool

This Django-based project provides a web-based Number Conversion Tool that allows users to convert numbers between different bases: Decimal, Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal. It includes a user-friendly interface to input the number, select the input base, and specify the output base for conversion. Currently this supports conversion from decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and binary number systems, sill be adding many more later.

Make sure you have Python and Django installed on your system if you don't have it, install Python and run pip install django in terminal. You may clone this Repo and execute python3 manage.py runserver command from root directory of this repo to run the Django server.
